# Email-DNS
DNS stands for Domain Name System and is a protocol for exchanging data on the Internet and  which will convert IPs to Email address.
We created this model in cisco packet tracer  and  We assign IPs to each PC and Server. It is required to keep IP in same network 
because here is connected network by single switch. There is no layer 3 device and VLAN. Then in mail servers we created the domain names for respective pc.
